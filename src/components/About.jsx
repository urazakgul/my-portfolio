          Hello there! My name is Uraz Akg√ºl and I have been coding using R
          and Python programming languages for many years. As someone who is
          deeply passionate about software, I have decided to pursue a career in
          the software industry.

        <p className="text-xl">
          I strongly believe that coding is about freedom, as it allows us to
          create new things and push the boundaries of what is possible. I take
          great pleasure in exploring new technologies and tools to find better
          and more efficient ways of solving problems. As someone who has taught
          themselves to code, I am constantly striving to learn and grow in this
          ever-changing field. My ultimate goal is to hold a prominent position
          in the industry, where I can use my skills to make a meaningful impact
          and contribute to the advancement of technology.
